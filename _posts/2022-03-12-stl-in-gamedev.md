Some time ago, I posted a [Twitter Thread](https://twitter.com/m_ninepoints/status/1497768472184430600) about STL usage in the games industry (largely geared toward
AAA game development), which sparked a lot of discussion. On the one hand, there was a fair bit of support for the general arguments presented, and on the other hand,
there were some detractors that didn't quite agree. This is... normal! I think it's valid for people to have distinct but equally valid approaches to solve problems.
One theme I noticed was that most of the debate centered specifically on the _performance_ angle of the argument, and while there are points to be made here, I
believe it's wrong to focus on performance at the exclusion of other topics.
