Hi. I'm a systems programmer with a particular bent on graphics and low-level programming. C++ is my primary
programming language, but I'm relatively language agnostic (except for a few languages on my naughty list).
Outside of graphics and performance work, I dabble a good deal with *most* other disciplines, priority
sorted based on interest. In particular, compilers/optimizers, networking, compression, security, and AI.

I post sporadically, but feedback and/or corrections on my content is always appreciated (see link badges
at the top right to find me on twitter/linkedin/etc).

If you're curious of the origin of the name "ninepoints," it's a reference to [Euler's nine point circle theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine-point_circle)
which is one of my favorite theorems.
