Hi. I'm a graphics programmer but with broader generalist capabilities also. C++ is my primary
programming language, but I'm relatively language agnostic (except for a few languages on my naughty list).

I post sporadically, but feedback and/or corrections on my content is always appreciated (see link badges
at the top to find me on twitter/linkedin/etc).

If you're curious of the origin of the name "ninepoints," it's a reference to [Euler's nine point circle theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine-point_circle)
which is one of my favorite theorems.
